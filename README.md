# Included
The following is what is included inside the ZIP
## Casio_files
Code asked for is inside here. Documentation is in comments inside.
## Proof
Proof of process is stored in here. If anything can't be found (such as the events), they will be found here because of my computer not accepting data transference between the Virtual Machine and the Host.
## Casio Generated Files
I had to hand-copy these ones. They are the results of the command ./casio_system system > {pre, post}_casio.txt
